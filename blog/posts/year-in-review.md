# year-in-review.md

looking back, this year has been intense in ways i did not anticipate.

it is hard to look back on this year without first acknowledging the obvious. technology continued to accelerate at a disorienting pace. AI was rapidly adopted across society at large, affecting how we think and how we perfom our work. productivity may have increased, but so did the unease about quality and security and what it even means anymore to truly understand how something works. people talked enthusiastically about prompts and about what may get lost when change happens this fast. i cannot help but feel like we are waiting for a bubble to burst, to see what sticks and what does not. and then there was trump's reelection, and the controversy surrounding both the result and the man himself. at the same time, conflicts intensified across myanmar and sudan, parts of the sahel and many other places in the world. i am surprised how easily immense human suffering can turn into background noise in the news. again and again, this year reminded me how normalized that has become. in many places democracy itself felt strained, perhaps more than people were willing to openly admit. add to that a year marked by extreme weather and persistent climate anxiety, and economic uncertainty. it is clear that this was not a calm year for anyone. this is not a post about explaining the world or making sense of all of that at scale. i am not here to analyze geopolitics, predict the future of AI or summarize 2025 as a whole. this post is much more personal, and if you are not interested in that, you do not have to read the rest of this post.

last year, i unintentionally wrote a year-in-review piece in my journal, something i never published and never intended to share. this coming year, i want to be more deliberate about improving my writing, which means writing and publishing more blog posts. so, to start things off, i have decided to actually share a year in review, this time written with the intention of being read. that said, it is worth noting that this is still something i am writing primarily for myself.

the biggest change this year has been that i graduated from university and started working at opera full time in january. going from studying at university for around five years, where you often have the freedom to plan your own time, to working full time with set routines, while also engaging in several organizations, has been difficult. in the beginning of the year, i almost burned out.

LiTHe Hax has grown a lot this year. we have ended up with almost 200 members and collaborations with high-profile companies and organizations. that growth has meant a lot of meetings. when i counted everything earlier this year, i realized i had been involved in over 80 meetings connected to the organization. alongside that, there was still a lot of hands-on work to do, like developing challenges and arranging the events we had planned. at the same time, i was involved in LiTHanian, which also means a lot of work. i will be honest, running a magazine is not an easy thing to do when you are not very experienced in that industry. i mainly continued as editor-in-chief because i was worried no one else would be elected, and i did not want things to get off to a late start. ironically, things did kick off late anyway, because i had to prioritize my full-time job and LiTHe Hax. on top of all this, i am involved in yet another organization that i want to put effort into. this amount of work broke me. for the first time, i had to seriously rethink how i approach life. for almost a year now, i have tried to figure out a routine that works, and as it turns out, it does not seem possible to do all of this in any healthy way.

this realization has caused a lot of reflection. about life, about myself and about what comes next. what i landed on is that i will step down from all my engagements this summer. right now, a lot of what i am doing is preparing to hand things over to other people. still, i would not say that i regret anything i have done, even though it has caused long-term mental and physical health problems. on the contrary, i have learned a lot of useful things.

one insight i gained this year is something i have heard about before but never really *felt* until now. just how much influence a small number of people and organizations actually have. i knew this on some level, of course. but there is a difference between understanding something intellectually and watching it play out in front of you. a lot of things happen because of a few key decisions made by people with power or money, and from the outside, it is often invisible. this year made me more curious and more critical. it pushed me to look at situations from angles i would not have considered before. i could write a lot more about this, but i won't, at least not yet. i am trying to stay out of political and philosophical debates until i have stepped down from my current positions.

aside from all of this, someone very close to me was diagnosed with cancer this year. that has shaken things up in ways that are hard to put into words. i get deeply attached to people, and the thought of losing someone i love fills me with a kind of anxiety that is hard to escape. other people in my inner circle have been going through their own painful struggles too. it has been a year of a lot of emotions, sometimes all at once. i think i might have felt every emotion there is to feel this year.

even though all of this is very serious and sad, good things have come from it too. it has forced me and hopefully people around me to pause, reflect and make changes so things can become better. one concrete thing i have done is to set aside time to rest and to educate myself. i have started reading and writing a lot again. writing to reflect, and reading to learn. i have also picked up other hobbies. when i work, effort and expectations are usually high, but thankfully, that isn't really the case with hobbies.

as you might notice, things have been weird and confusing.

## the goals i didn't reach

while clearing out my computer a few days ago, i came across a list i had written before new year's last year. it was about 25 things i wanted to do this year. out of those, i did not complete six. i thought i would share what those things were, and why they did not happen.

### quit coffee

i have been drinking multiple cups of coffee almost every day since high school. i have quit cold turkey a few times before and managed to stay off it for a few months at a time. caffeine has never affected me negatively, but this year i have been struggling a lot with stress and anxiety, and i wanted to quit coffee to try, at least partially, to improve my health. i ended up quitting for around two to three months. what i realized, though, is that i really enjoy the social aspects of drinking coffee. i like the taste, the process of making it, and the break it forces you to take. so instead of quitting completely, i have limited my intake to a maximum of one cup per day.

### quit alcohol

similarly to coffee, and essentially for the same reasons, i tried to quit alcohol completely. and i did, for the same period of time as i quit coffee. then my company traveled to italy to celebrate turning 30, and during that trip i wanted to drink for social reasons. when i came back to sweden, i started going on dates, and attending parties and events with friends where drinking was involved, and i never quite found my way back to not drinking at all. either way, i still think it would be healthier to consume less alcohol. and while i probably won't stop completely, since i have realized there are good aspects to it as well, i do want to be much closer to not drinking at all than to drinking every weekend, for example.

### build a new server

i have had a custom-built web server for a while, where i have hosted several services, websites and other types of software. as many of you already know, i have been getting more involved in the hacking and cybersecurity community lately. some of the things i hosted turned out to be misconfigured and i started seeing suspicious activity on my machine and network. that made me unplug my ethernet cable from the wall and start reconfiguring everything. it turns out this is very time-consuming, and i did not have the resources available this year. instead, i migrated everything to already properly configured cloud services. that is why i did not build a new server, and also why i probably won't do it anytime soon.

### get a driver's license

i have started the process, and i probably only have a few lessons left before i can pass. i simply have not had enough free time to fit all the lessons in this year. because of that, i am expecting to get my license early next year.

### become fully vegan

i have been eating vegetarian food for around seven years. in the beginning, i had political and ideological reasons, but as i have grown older, i have loosened my stance on many of the arguments i had back then. now i am at a stage where i am used to eating vegan food and genuinely enjoy it, so why not go all the way? this actually started off well. at the beginning of the year, when i cooked all my food myself, i ate fully vegan. but as i started eating out more with friends and colleagues, and traveling more, the options became limited. for example, when going to brazil, parts of the journey did not even have vegetarian options available, and i had to eat fish to stay healthy. reflecting on this, i might never become fully vegan, but at the very least, whenever i cook food at home, it is fully vegan. for now, that is probably as far as i will go.

### write in my journal every day for a year

i started strong. i wrote in my physical journal every day for most of january, and every time i have been traveling this year, i have also been writing. but it did not hold for every single day. i think the reason is that i set the bar too high. every entry had to be at least one A4 page of text, which was not sustainable. instead of helping, it made me feel overwhelmed every time i saw the journal, and eventually, i ended up writing nothing at all.

## five things i learned this year

to provide some value for people besides myself, i thought i would share five lessons i have learned this year.

### high expectations can work against you

one of my main problems has been that i set my expectations too high on myself, and on the people around me. this has followed me in almost everything i do. looking back, i can see how this kind of thinking slowly wears you down. when your standards are rigid and unforgiving, they stop being motivating and start being exhausting. high expectations are not inherently bad, but when you cannot adjust them based on reality, they tend to hurt more than they help. what i have learned is that expectations need to be flexible and realistic (and aware of context). sometimes "good enough" really is good enough.

### rest isn't optional

early this year, i was involved in multiple organizations, studying free-standing courses at several universities and working full time. i simply did not have enough time to sleep and recover properly. when you do that long enough, your body will react. you get sick more often, recovery slows down, and you are tired all the time. concentration and decision-making become harder, and your body just does not feel good. no matter how much motivation you have, lack of rest will eventually catch up with you. the lesson for me has been to focus on fewer things and to actually prioritize recovery, not as a reward, but as a requirement.

### relationships are worth the effort

this year, i started prioritizing relationships in a more intentional way. family, friends, dates, etc. i stopped just keeping them alive so they would not "die out" and started actually investing in them. this has genuinely affected me positively. i am lucky to have people in my life who care about me and making time for them has made everything else more manageable. prioritizing relationships is not a distraction from productivity.

### life will go on without you

this has been one of the hardest lessons for me to accept. it became very clear in LiTHe Hax, where i was essentially a single point of failure. i was the only admin in our digital systems, the main person attending meetings and heavily involved in almost everything. then i got sick and had to step away for a few weeks and naturally the organization was affected. but that is not healthy. being indispensable is often a warning sign, not a strength. together, the organization and i worked to spread out responsibilities so others could take on as much as i did. and when things are structured like that, life can continue even when you are not present. this applies far beyond organizations. it is easy to believe you are uniquely needed, but that belief is often more harmful than helpful. to yourself and to others.

### it's okay to say no

it is okay to say no. it is okay not to be perfect. being honest about your limits tends to be better in the long run than constantly overcommitting. if you do things just to be nice, or out of obligation rather than genuine motivation, it will eventually affect your mental health. and realistically, it won't be well executed anyway if you do not actually want to do it. i would rather spend more time on my hobbies than say yes to something i already know i do not want to do. that said, i do not want to be extreme. there is value in balance, and it is probably healthy to push your boundaries sometimes. the key lesson for me has been learning when to push and when to stop.

## what's next

right now, i am in a place where i genuinely do not know what will happen next in my life. i know that i will step down from all of my engagements this coming summer, but beyond that, i have no clear plan. i do not know if i will replace them with something else, or if i will simply appreciate the time i will have available, maybe use it to rest, or apply everything i learned i did wrong last year. maybe start building a family. who knows. the only thing i do know is that next year will be an even more unusual year than this one, at least when compared to how i have been living my life up until now.

of course, i would not be myself if i did not set any goals at all. not just for next year, but for the future in general. i do not necessarily believe in new year's resolutions, but i do believe in self-improvement, and i believe it should be allowed to take as much time as it needs. i also believe in the feeling you get when reaching goals, no matter how big or small. you have to allow yourself to feel successful sometimes.

## goals for next year

1. **end all engagements outside of work**, i have been involved in organizations in my spare time since i was 13 years old. when i have not been at school or working, i have usually spent my time thinking about work or organizational responsibilities anyway. this year, that lifestyle finally caught up with me. it is about time i aim for a healthier work–life balance.

2. **continue focusing on hobbies**, i started prioritizing hobbies more this year, and it has become very clear that this is where i get my energy from. i want to keep spending time reading and writing, taking photos and videos, and programming, without turning these things into obligations.

3. **continue focusing on relationships**, i talked about this earlier, and it is something i want to keep prioritizing.

4. **get a driver's license**, i have never really needed a car earlier in life. but now that i have settled more, it is obvious that having a license would give me more freedom, being able to visit people in other cities, or even other countries, more easily. i think that if i do not do this now, i probably will not do it later.

5. **finish my book, and remove my old one from the face of the earth**, looking back at my first book, it is pretty cringe. it was not even meant to be published at first. i wish i had spent more time on it and waited a year or so before deciding whether it was ready. i will try to remove all traces of it from the internet, as if that is really possible, haha. since then, i have written a new book in english, and i think it is less cringe and more thought through. but who knows, maybe the cycle will repeat itself.

6. **journal every day, no matter how much or how little i write**, the mistake last year was setting the bar too high. i am pretty sure this will be possible if i simply avoid setting too many expectations. it is always interesting to read what i wrote a few months, or years ago.

7. **lower my expectations of myself and others**, this has probably been my biggest problem for most of my life. i have always set very high expectations for myself, which has led to a lot of stress and a lot of time spent on things i might not even want to do. on one hand, this often means things are well executed. on the other, it affects my mental health negatively, and most of the time i end up disappointed anyway. my natural response after finishing something is that it was not good enough, and that i need to do better next time. since i expect this of myself, i often expect the same from others. but most people are healthier than me in that regard, they know it is unrealistic, so they simply do not do it. what usually happens then is that i take on the work myself. that does not help anyone.

8. **sleep more**, this one is self-explanatory. i genuinely think a lot of things in my life would turn out better if i just got more sleep.

9. **lower my intake of alcohol and caffeine**, i have talked about this earlier, but i still believe this could reduce a lot of the unnecessary anxiety i have been experiencing.

10. **visit all the european countries i haven't been to yet**, this is more of an extra goal. over the past years, i have realized how much i enjoy traveling, and i want to make room for more of it.

## thank you

i would not have been able to go through all of this on my own, and i know how fortunate i am not to be alone in it. i have not felt lonely this year, and i am incredibly thankful for that. it has been very clear to me that i have friends and family who genuinely care about me, and i care about you back. thank you for everything you have done for me this year. i hope i can give back and contribute just as much to your well-being and growth in life.

to end this, i have just set up a new email system for interacting with people online. i would really love to hear about your year, whether we know each other or not. what were your goals? did you reach them? tell me about it. i am genuinely curious to hear from you.

**hello@tavro.se**
