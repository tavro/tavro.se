        my life is often busy, and i've been somewhat secretive when sharing
        details with family and friends. i thought this would be a great way to
        keep everyone updated on what i'm currently doing. i'll do my best to
        keep this page updated with any new happenings. thank you,

        health-wise things have gotten a bit worse again, but i am actively taking steps to feel better, like cutting back on alcohol and coffee. i have great support from the people around me, which keeps me optimistic that things will improve soon. my engagements are peaking right now, which probably explains why things have been a bit rough lately. regarding the housing situation, i have finally signed a contract for a new apartment in the city center, just a two minute walk from my workplace! i will be moving in early january, which i am really looking forward to.

      <h2>work 💼</h2>
      <h3>Opera Software</h3>
      <p>
      first off i would like to correct a statement from last month's now page, apparently, one of the people i referred did get the job! it just took a bit longer than i expected. we even ended up working on the same team, though he is on the backend side of things. as i mentioned last month, opera is turning 30 this year, and to celebrate, the whole company spent almost a week at a resort in tuscany. it was an amazing trip and i am attaching a video from it further down this page! one of the many highlights was a talk by Håkon, the inventor of CSS and former Opera CTO. aside from the vacation, there has also been a lot of exciting progress within our product. we recently launched a feature for native cross-chain deposits, which is pretty groundbreaking in the crypto space. and there is even more innovation on the way! i will not spoil it just yet, but expect some news next month (or the one after). stay tuned!
      </p>
      <h2>organizations 🏢</h2>
      <h3>LiTHe Hax</h3>
      <p>
      LiTHe Hax has pretty much turned into a full-time job for many of our board members lately. our event, LiU CTF, has grown much larger than i ever anticipated. one big reason for this is our collaboration with LiU and Gurjot, our contact from IEEE Sweden, along with his colleague Harry, who has helped us test and refine our challenges. they have both been incredibly supportive and dedicated a lot of time to improving and assisting with different aspects of the event. originally, we planned to limit participation to 120 people, but we didn't manage to close the registration form in time, so we ended up with almost 170 registered participants, including sponsor teams and organizers. that is quite a lot for an on-site event that has only happened once before! i am super excited, the event kicks off in exactly one week! you can read more about it on our website or social media channels. besides LiU CTF, we have also organized several events in collaboration with foo café, GOTO10 and Linköping Science Park, though our main focus has definitely been on the CTF. we also had a kick-off with the CTF committee, where we played a CTF-themed drinking game. we competed in solving challenges of varying team sizes and difficulty levels, and the losing team had to drink each round.

      <h3>LiTHanian</h3>
      <p>
      i have finally managed to recruit an editorial team, and we have started working on our first issue of the year. this one is going to be a bit different, and i am confident it will be for the better. there is not much more to share at this stage, but i am sure i will have more to say next month once the magazine is finished.
      </p>
      <h2>hobbies ⚙️</h2>
      <h3>programming</h3>
      <p>
      i have actually been doing quite a bit of programming lately. most of my time has been spent working on my website, where i have added new content to the explore page and fixed a few things i have been meaning to get to for a while. aside from that, i have been developing 12 CTF challenges for LiU CTF. i have also started a project for my colleagues at Opera, which is about sharing music within the team. this is still in the very early stages, so i will share more about it at a later point.

      <p>i have not taken a single photo this month either. but here is the video from operas italy trip.</p>

      <h3>music</h3>
      <p>
      since i haven't made any music in a while and probably won't for some time, i have decided to start sharing some stats here instead. as of now, i have listened to 1444 songs this month, averaging 57 listens per day. my top artist this month has been Kate Stephenson, and my top album has been moisturizer by Wet Leg. the most played song has also been "Going On Words" by Kate Stephenson. the day i listened to the most songs was october 19th, with 163 songs played. the last song i listened to as of writing this was "Sylvia" by Julien Baker.

        expert in a field is derived from

        >i've been tracking my programming time since 2019, so these numbers are
        based on that data. the actual total is likely higher, considering i
        wrote my first program before i started tracking my time! please note
        that i include this jokingly; i don't necessarily believe in the idea of
        becoming an expert after 10,000 hours. i haven't given it much thought,
        and i certainly don't feel like an expert yet.</small
