        my life is often busy, and i've been somewhat secretive when sharing
        details with family and friends. i thought this would be a great way to
        keep everyone updated on what i'm currently doing. i'll do my best to
        keep this page updated with any new happenings. thank you,

        i spent most of november in brazil with some friends / colleagues which was an awesome experience. two of them are from brazil and kindly invited me and I am really grateful for that. navigating without them would have been tough, especially since most people there don’t speak english there. we visited brasília, são paulo and lençóis. I could write an entire blog post about the trip! but I will keep it brief. let’s just say, coming back to cold and dark sweden after 30+ degree sunny weather was quite the shock to the system, haha.

      <p>
      as i mentioned, I have been on vacation for most of this month, so I have not been as active lately. that said, there are still some exciting things happening! right now we are focusing on local payments and virtual cards, though I am not sure how much i can share just yet. one thing I can mention is that my team is currently looking for a data analyst. so, if you know me and happen to be reading this, feel free to reach out, if you are interested, i’d be happy to refer you as a candidate!

      <h2>organizations 🏢</h2>
      <h3>LiTHe Hax</h3>
      <p>
      we hosted our flagship CTF event on november 1 at ada lovelace, ljusgården, and the cybersecurity labs at linköpings university. the event ran from 10:00 to 18:30, with 106 participants in 32 teams across beginner and experienced tracks, and 142 attendees in total (including volunteers and guests). we offered a range of challenge categories, including social engineering, web, steganography, blockchain, reverse engineering, OSINT, networking, hardware, forensics, cryptography and more… participants included high school students, university students, PhD candidates and industry professionals. a highlight was the 15% female participation (increase from the usual 4% at similar events).
      </p>
      <h3>LiTHanian</h3>
      <p>
      unfortunately i have not been able to prioritize LiTHanian as much as i would like, but my amazing and driven editorial team has been handling things well. our first issue is almost complete, and i am really proud of the content. i will share more details next month!
      </p>
      <h2>hobbies ⚙️</h2>
      <h3>programming</h3>
      <p>
      i made a few small updates to my website and did some programming with a friend at a bar, just teaching him a bit about HTML. that is about it for coding this month. i also looked into using spotify’s API, but have not done anything hands-on yet.
      </p>
      <h3>photography</h3>
      <p>for once, i have actually been taking some photos. unfortunately, my optical zoom camera broke while i was in the dunes (sand got into the lens and sensor). i will try to fix it and pass it on to a friend who is into bird watching. i have also bought a nikon D850, so expect better photos in the future!</p>
