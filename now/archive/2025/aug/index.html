        my life is often busy, and i've been somewhat secretive when sharing
        details with family and friends. i thought this would be a great way to
        keep everyone updated on what i'm currently doing. i'll do my best to
        keep this page updated with any new happenings. thank you,

          this month has been pretty tough. i’ve been dealing with what i
          believe are stress-related health issues, and they’ve become quite
          serious. i’ve experienced stroke-like symptoms and even had to call an
          ambulance at one point. these issues have been ongoing for about half
          a year now, but they’ve never felt this severe before. i’m now in
          contact with my hospital regarding this. if i had to guess, i’d say it
          might be because all of my engagements have started up again after the
          summer. that said, things have been improving towards the end of the
          month. last month, i mentioned that i was thinking about moving, and
          now i’ve actually taken the first step, i found an apartment closer to
          the city center and sent in my application, hopefully, i’ll get it! if
          so i'll move in early december. it’s in the same price range as my
          current place, but a little bigger and it even has a dishwasher, haha.
          as i’m writing this, i’m on my way home from oslo, norway. it was my
          first time there, and i went just to relax and take some time for
          myself. it was totally worth it, although i have to say oslo is
          extremely expensive. for example, i couldn’t find a single bar selling
          beer for under 110 SEK. i guess it’s the same in stockholm and other
          big cities, though, i’m not sure. i think i mentioned this last month
          (or the month before), but i’m also working on getting my driver’s
          license. i have five more driving lessons left before i attempt the
          final test.

      <h3>Opera Software</h3>
      <p>
        things at opera are really exciting right now! i’m not sure how much i’m
        allowed to share at the moment, but i can say that a lot is happening
        both around the app i’m working on and at opera as a whole. this year
        marks opera’s 30th anniversary, and there’s a big internal event planned
        to celebrate. our app will also be mentioned in the upcoming quarterly
        report, which is a good sign, i think. on top of that, we’re hiring new
        employees, and i’m currently in the process of referring my second
        friend to interview for a role. in a month or two, i’ll probably be able
        to talk more about what i’ve found so exciting this month, so stay
        tuned!

      <h2>organizations 🏢</h2>
      <h3>LiTHe Hax</h3>
      <p>
        LiTHe Hax is back after a short summer break, and more active than ever!
        we were recently contacted by IEEE, who want to collaborate with us. the
        plan is to organize a large ctf in november, specifically aimed at women
        and high school students. to make this happen, we’re expanding our
        organization and creating what we call the “ctf committee.” if you’re
        interested in joining, just send me an email! in addition to this, we’ll
        also be hosting a mini ctf at goto 10 tomorrow, together with foo café,
        who will provide food and drinks. the plan is to play PicoCTF with our
        members, if they show up ;-P we’ve also been attending lots of meetings
        lately, exploring potential sponsorships for upcoming events. on top of
        that, we painted our logo on märkesbacken at linköping university, as
        you can see below in the photography section.
      </p>
      <h3>LiTHanian</h3>
      <p>
        our last issue has finally reached our members mailboxes, which also
        means recruiting for the new editorial team has begun. this will be a
        historic year for LiTHanian, as we will no longer be able to send out
        our first issue to all students at the faculty of science and
        engineering. this means we’ll need to find creative new ways to market
        the magazine. the plan is to focus more on digital solutions this year,
        with the hope of reaching a wider audience. we’ll see how it develops.
        as for LiTHe Hax, i also painted the logo on Märkesbacken. aside from
        that, there isn’t much more to update at the moment, since i don’t yet
        have a new editorial team in place just yet.

      <h2>hobbies ⚙️</h2>
      <h3>programming</h3>
      <p>
        since i got my glove80s, development has been a bit slow, haha. i’ve
        mainly been working on two projects. the first one is "jakel", my
        custom-built text editor. i started it mostly for fun and to learn, but
        i’ve actually been using it for real development work. i’ve been
        gradually adding features i need along the way. it’s written in C, and
        it’s been really enjoyable to dive back into C programming, i actually
        really like the language. the second project is "BEM", my own browser
        engine. i’ve been spending some time researching how browsers work,
        which seemed like a good idea since i work at a browser company, lol.
        just like with jakel, i’m mainly doing it as a learning project. right
        now, i’m in the process of rewriting the html parser, since my first
        attempt wasn’t very good.

          i’m still mainly focused on taking photos for my next book, so there’s
          nothing i’ll be sharing here just yet. i’ve also started a new
          photography project, but i’m keeping the concept to myself for now,
          and if i never finish it, at least there won’t be any traces of it
          online. ;-) that said, i did take some photos during my trip to
          norway.

      <h3>music</h3>
      <p>
        i haven’t been making any music lately, but i’ve been listening to a lot
        of it. that was actually the main thing i did while in oslo, walking in
        nature with music in my headphones, going to the bob hund concert, and
        visiting different bars with live music. it was a lot of fun. i really
        enjoy discovering new bands and lesser known artists. one highlight was
        a norwegian band called "Drakånis", who opened for bob hund. they were
        super cool and have a lot of potential, so i’ve started following them
        on spotify.

      <p>
        i don’t have much to share here. most of my spare time has gone into
        practicing typing with my glove80s, so apart from blog posts and
        journaling, i haven’t really been writing.

      <h2>expert progress 🎓</h2>
      <p>
        the concept of reaching 10,000 hours to become a professional or an
        expert in a field is derived from

        wrote my first program before i started tracking my time! please note
        that i include this jokingly; i don't necessarily believe in the idea of
        becoming an expert after 10,000 hours. i haven't given it much thought,
        and i certainly don't feel like an expert yet.</small
