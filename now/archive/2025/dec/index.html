					<h2>what are you doing?</h2>
      					<p>this is a <mark><a href="https://nownownow.com/about">now page</a></mark>. if you have your own site, you should make one too!</p>
      					<p>my life is often busy, and i've been somewhat secretive when sharing details with family and friends. i thought this would be a great way to keep everyone updated on what i'm currently doing. i'll do my best to keep this page updated with any new happenings. thank you, <mark><a href="https://phillipridlen.com/">Phillip Ridlen</a></mark>, for inspiring me with <mark><a href="https://phillipridlen.com/now/">your now page</a></mark>!</p>
      					<p>this was what i was doing as of <b>december 31 2025</b></p>

        					<p>i hope you had a wonderful christmas and that new year’s will be just as good. i am really enjoying having a few days off and i have finally moved into my new apartment! on top of that, one of my close friends from india has come to sweden for a few months, so we had a few drinks at my place with her husband and another friend. i also recently discovered google’s built-in password manager, something i somehow missed for most of my life. i was surprised (and a bit concerned) to learn that it stores passwords in clear text in the browser and that it has been saving my account details for years without me realizing it. as a result, i spent a sad amount of time going through all my accounts, removing the stored passwords and resetting or deleting accounts where necessary and downloading any associated data.</p>

      					<h3>Opera Software</h3>
      					<p>things are changing in MiniPay now that we have introduced virtual cards and accounts. this feature lets users link real-world bank details directly to their wallet so they can receive payments via virtual USD or EUR accounts and spend or withdraw the funds using a virtual card. virtual accounts let you receive ACH and SEPA transfers straight into MiniPay, which are then automatically converted into stablecoins like USDT and USDC. the first purchase made with the virtual card was a bottle of champagne from Systembolaget and a lunch with the team. i have been working on the front-end features that will be released sometime after new year’s. this includes a card stack UI with smooth animations and transitions. we are moving away from the old “pockets” concept and turning each pocket into a card instead.</p>

								<p>we have published this year’s CTF christmas challenge, feel free to try to find the flag! also, apparently, LiTHe Hax was mentioned in the swedish riksdag. i do not know exactly what was said, but i heard about it during a meeting with a university employee. i believe it was related to us getting our own room on the university campus, which is really exciting. aside from that, we are now off for the holidays.</p>

      							<p>i have been setting up a new mail domain, which i might also use for other projects, we will see. i have started migrating away from Google services to self‑hosted alternatives, and i have begun rewriting my website (again). on top of that, i have been hacking and participating in CTFs, i just finished Hack The Box’s Advent of Cyber and managed to find 29 out of 34 flags in the University CTF 2025. and, of course, i have been working as well.</p>

					<h2>expert progress 🎓</h2>
      					<p>the concept of reaching 10,000 hours to become a professional or an expert in a field is derived from <mark><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malcolm_Gladwell">Malcolm Gladwell</a></mark>'s book <mark><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outliers_(book)">"Outliers: The Story of Success"</a></mark>. gladwell popularized the idea that achieving a high level of proficiency in any field typically requires about 10,000 hours of dedicated practice. this notion is based on the research of psychologist <mark><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K._Anders_Ericsson">Anders Ericsson</a></mark>, who studied the practice habits of elite performers in various domains.</p>

      					<small>i've been tracking my programming time since 2019, so these numbers are based on that data. the actual total is likely higher, considering i wrote my first program before i started tracking my time! please note that i include this jokingly; i don't necessarily believe in the idea of becoming an expert after 10,000 hours. i haven't given it much thought, and i certainly don't feel like an expert yet.</small>
