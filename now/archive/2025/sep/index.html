        my life is often busy, and i've been somewhat secretive when sharing
        details with family and friends. i thought this would be a great way to
        keep everyone updated on what i'm currently doing. i'll do my best to
        keep this page updated with any new happenings. thank you,

          health wise, i have been feeling physically better since last month,
          which is a relief. mentally it has been tougher. my grandmother was
          recently diagnosed with cancer, and just thinking about it makes me
          sad. on top of that, i have been dealing with some personal challenges
          and a pretty busy schedule. i am pushing through, though, and trying
          to do things that make life a little better. that said, it is not all
          heavy, there are plenty of good things happening too, and i don't want
          to overlook them. i'll share more about the fun stuff further down
          this page. as for a quick update on housing, the apartment i initially
          signed for turned out to be too small to fit everything i want to
          keep, so i declined the offer. i'm back to actively searching for a
          place that works better. on a brighter note, one of my close friends
          came from india to visit. we grabbed a beer and caught up, it was
          really nice.

      <h3>Opera Software</h3>
      <p>
        we have just rolled out a new update for our product. one feature is an
        integration that allows users to deposit money from other crypto-based
        wallets. we also launched a QR code scanner for iOS (along with
        improvements for the android version), which i had the chance to work
        on. that was a fun and a great learning experience. recently, i have
        also been working on setting up an automated testing environment for the
        app together with one of our senior developers. on another note, as i
        briefly mentioned last month, Opera is celebrating its 30th anniversary
        this year and we will be traveling to italy next month to mark the
        occasion, i am really excited about that! as for my friends i tried
        refer to the company, unfortunately none of them got the job this time.
        hopefully, they will reapply in the future and get another shot.

      <h2>organizations 🏢</h2>
      <h3>LiTHe Hax</h3>
      <p>
        A LOT has happened since last month! first off, we have been busy
        recruiting new members. we attended an event called Kalasmässan, where
        we had a booth, and we also did some separate marketing at LiU
        beforehand, again with a booth. the biggest news is that we selected 8
        new members for our brand new CTF Committee. they will be working
        actively on designing challenges for our upcoming event, LiU CTF. with
        them on board, we're now a team of 16 people actively involved in
        running the organization. on top of that, we have gained more sponsors
        and collaborators for LiU CTF, which is great! registration is
        officially open, so if you are into Capture the Flag competitions and
        can make it to Sweden until the first of November, we would love to see
        you there! we also recently took part in Crew CTF, a challenging
        competition hosted by one of our hacker friends. we did not solve many
        challenges this time, but it was still a lot of fun. just yesterday, we
        visited my old high school to recruit members and potential participants
        for LiU CTF. beyond that, we have been teaching people how to hack
        NFC-based cards at GOTO10, in collaboration with EnlightSec and
        Norrköpings Kommun. we also have an ongoing partnership with DFIR Sweden
        for a conference in March, which we will help organize. DFIR works with
        digital forensics and incident response, so that is a great fit for us.
        and lastly, tomorrow, we have an meeting about another collaboration
        with WebbU, a web related committee i have been leading in the past.
        right now, it looks like we will join them for an event i originally
        founded a few years ago, which feels like the stars are aligning
        perfectly, haha.

      <h3>LiTHanian</h3>
      <p>
        at the moment, not much is happening within LiTHanian, as i am currently
        focused on recruiting a new editorial team. most of the work right now
        is planning for upcoming issues, but nothing i can share publicly just
        yet. fingers crossed, i will have some proper updates next month!
      </p>
      <h2>hobbies ⚙️</h2>
      <h3>programming</h3>
      <p>
        i have mostly been reviewing and working on the LiTHe Hax website, which
        has gotten quite a facelift, both in terms of design and functionality,
        thanks to our webmaster! on the side, i have been making slow but steady
        progress on my browser engine. i have really wanted to spend more time
        on jakel too, but unfortunately haven't had the chance yet. hopefully i
        will be able to dive into it soon. i also created a new website for my
        latest poetry collection. in the end i decided to collaborate with
        independent photographers, with the hope that their work will gain some
        visibility too. so, if you are a photographer that want to get your work
        recognized, please reach out!
      </p>
      <h3>photography</h3>
      <p>surprisingly, i have not taken a single photo this month.</p>
      <h3>music</h3>
      <p>
        i have not made any new music since last time, but i have been exploring
        a lot of smaller artists. one i would like to highlight is ducksmithson.
        their music is calm, soft, cool and really clever, imo. definitely worth
        a listen!
      </p>
      <h3>writing</h3>
      <p>i haven't done much writing this month.</p>
      <h3>reading</h3>
      <div class="book-section">
        <img src="./res/men.jpg" />
        <p>
          i have started reading
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Who_Have_Never_Known_Men"
            >I Who Have Never Known Men</a
          >, a book a friend recommended to me. i am only about a quarter of the
          way through, but so far it has been a really good read!

      <h2>expert progress 🎓</h2>
      <p>
        the concept of reaching 10,000 hours to become a professional or an
        expert in a field is derived from

        dedicated practice. this notion is based on the research of psychologist

        >i've been tracking my programming time since 2019, so these numbers are
        based on that data. the actual total is likely higher, considering i
        wrote my first program before i started tracking my time! please note
        that i include this jokingly; i don't necessarily believe in the idea of
        becoming an expert after 10,000 hours. i haven't given it much thought,
        and i certainly don't feel like an expert yet.</small
