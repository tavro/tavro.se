        <p class="gray">This is <a href="https://nownownow.com/about">a now page</a>. If you have your own site, you should make one, too!</p>
        <p>My life is often busy, and I've been somewhat secretive when sharing details with family and friends. I thought this would be a great way to keep everyone updated on what I'm currently doing. I'll do my best to keep this page updated with any new happenings. Thank you, <a href="https://phillipridlen.com/">Phillip Ridlen</a>, for inspiring me with <a href="https://phillipridlen.com/now/">your now page</a>!</p>

                <p>After moving more than 20 times in the past, I believe I've finally found a place where I can settle for a while. For the past two years, I've been living in a spacious apartment just a stone's throw from the University in Linköping. I share my home with two charming ringneck doves, Da Vinki and Boye. Beside my birds, I'm fortunate to have a fantastic, talkative roommate who, fun fact, is over 2 meters tall and tells captivating stories.</p>

        <h3>Education 🎓</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>I am currently in my final year of a master's program in Computer Science and Software Engineering at <a href="https://liu.se/">Linköpings University</a>, where I have specialized in Networks and Security. Additionally, I have taken courses related to operating systems and language construction, which are my primary interests. Recently, I enjoyed reading <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compilers:_Principles,_Techniques,_and_Tools">"The Dragon Book"</a> in my free time for fun. Besides my studies at Linköping University, I have also pursued extra courses at various institutions, including <a href="https://www.kau.se/">Karlstad University</a>, <a href="https://www.uu.se/">Uppsala University</a>, <a href="https://www.miun.se/en/">Mid Sweden University</a>, and the <a href="https://www.hb.se/">University of Borås</a>. This has allowed me to broaden my perspectives and learn without focusing on exam requirements. I am considering pursuing a Ph.D. in the future, but that is still uncertain!</p>
        <h3>Work 💼</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>I am currently a summer intern testing engineer at <a href="https://entiros.se/">Entiros Integrations AB</a>. Alongside my colleague, I am working on creating end-to-end and frontend tests for <a href="https://www.starlify.com/">Starlify</a>. Once this project is complete, I will return to <a href="https://www.opera.com/">Opera Sweden AB</a> to work on my master's thesis project — a gRPC API platform, similar to Postman.</p>
        <h3>Organizations 🏢</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>I've recently founded an ethical hacking organization called <a href="https://lithehax.se/">LiTHe Hax</a>. The board and I are currently working on developing our visual identity and creating a membership portal. Once these are completed, we will begin recruiting members, competing in CTFs, and organizing workshops and lectures on hacking and cybersecurity. I've partnered with <a href="https://linkopingsciencepark.se/cyberly-2/">Cyberly</a>, which has been an exciting collaboration! I also want to extend a heartfelt thank you to Assistant Professor <a href="https://liu.se/medarbetare/mikas34">Mikael Asplund</a> for inspiring me to start this organization and for all the support we've received.</p>
        <p>I was elected Editor-in-Chief of <a href="https://lithanian.se">LiTHanian</a>, the student magazine of the technical faculties. In this role, I will lead a team of approximately 15 graphic designers, writers, photographers, and logistics personnel, whom I am currently recruiting. Our goal is to publish four issues in the upcoming year. This experience is quite different from my previous organizational roles, and I am extremely excited about it!</p>
        <h3>Expert Progress 📈</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>The concept of reaching 10,000 hours to become a professional or an expert in a field is derived from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malcolm_Gladwell">Malcolm Gladwell</a>'s book <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outliers_(book)">"Outliers: The Story of Success"</a> Gladwell popularized the idea that achieving a high level of proficiency in any field typically requires about 10,000 hours of dedicated practice. This notion is based on the research of psychologist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K._Anders_Ericsson">Anders Ericsson</a>, who studied the practice habits of elite performers in various domains.</p>

            </div>
        </div>
        <p class="gray">I've been tracking my programming time since 2019, so these numbers are based on that data. The actual total is likely higher, considering I wrote my first program in 2012! Please note that I include this jokingly; I don't necessarily believe in the idea of becoming an expert after 10,000 hours. I haven't given it much thought, and I certainly don't feel like an expert yet.</p>
        <h3>Hobby Projects ⚙️</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>For me, having hobbies outside of studying and working is very important. Currently, my main hobbies are programming, photography, music, and writing. I tend to switch between projects frequently, so completed projects aren't very common. But that's the beauty of hobbies — you don't have to prove anything; you can engage in them purely for enjoyment. And when it stops being fun, it's time to move on!</p>
        <p>When it comes to programming, I'm currently working on two active projects: <a href="https://isakhorvath.me">my personal website</a> (this page, basically) and <a href="https://github.com/tavro/tugs">TUGS</a>, a script designed to make tasks involving <a href="https://git-scm.com/">Git</a> and <a href="https://trello.com/">Trello</a> less troublesome.</p>

                <p>At the beginning of this summer, I took a solo Euro trip and captured many photos along the way. Here are a few of my favorites from the hundreds I took. The cat photo was taken in Amsterdam, Netherlands. The next image is from Venice, Italy, and the last one is from Berlin, Germany.</p>

        <p>In music, I recently discovered the world of modular synthesizers. I'm in the process of collecting modules to build a setup for producing an EP of my own instrumental tracks.</p>
        <p>I'm also a big fan of poetry. Here's a poem I wrote recently:</p>
        <div class="poem">
            <p class="stanza">
                your diary, lost, by me was found<br>
                invites me in, to touch, to feel<br>
                to let me read
            </p>
            <p class="stanza">
                reveal the depths, the fears<br>
                for in your words, i find my peace
            </p>
            <p class="stanza">
                a silent ode to a heavy heart<br>
                a place of rest, from the world apart,<br>
                where whispers linger and tears are shed
            </p>
            <p class="stanza">
                in the cradle of your gentle hold,<br>
                in the middle of the night,<br>
                i seek your touch
            </p>
            <p class="stanza">
                "build us a coffin," you said, for the love we've lost<br>
                so let this grave, by my own hands made,<br>
                be not just a spot where I am laid
            </p>
            <p class="stanza">
                so I carve my path through the earthen bed<br>
                and here's to the girl with the angel's face<br>
                with the beautiful mind
            </p>
            <p class="stanza">
                when thoughts dance freely<br>
                feel the calm, the serene,<br>
                in places,<br>
                you've never been
            </p>
            <p class="stanza">
                let the world around you sleep<br>
                close your eyes, and drift away,<br>
                to where the night meets the day<br>
                to tender moments spent with me
            </p>
            <p class="stanza">
                a world unnoticed, yet fully alive
            </p>
