        					<p>to start off the year, i had a big party in my new apartment. over 30 of my friends came and i had a blast. some people stayed until 6 a.m. the morning after the party, which is a good sign to me. i am really happy and feel so lucky to have my friends in my life. i also went to Green Bay, Wisconsin, for a week to visit a friend and her husband. it was the first time the three of us met in real life, and we got along really well. i stayed at a hotel not far from where they live. it really struck me how fucked you are if you do not have a car in the US, especially when it is snowy and cold (it was −18°C at one point, and the trees were “exploding”). the sidewalks were not even cleared of snow, and everything was so far apart. there was not really a downtown area, apart from two roads, but those roads did have a lot going on. i went to bars, restaurants, museums and hung out with my friends. i also lost my rings in the US, which is unfortunate… anyway, on the flight home from Detroit, i sat next to a priest, and we talked for most of the seven-hour flight. it was an interesting experience. i also ran into jeb at arlanda when i got back to sweden, haha.</p>

      							<h3>programming</h3>
      							<p>when it comes to programming, i have been doing a bunch of things, mostly related to the website. i have reorganized everything and developed some tooling to make development and maintenance easier and more efficient. for example, i wrote a script for archiving old now pages. i have also added a notes section to my explore page. i have been wanting to do this for quite some time, as i often want to share things and write smaller snippets of text without turning them into full blog posts. now, i think i might share things more frequently there. i have also started working on a new programming language, just for fun.</p>

					<h2>expert progress 🎓</h2>
      					<p>the concept of reaching 10,000 hours to become a professional or an expert in a field is derived from <mark><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malcolm_Gladwell">Malcolm Gladwell</a></mark>'s book <mark><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outliers_(book)">"Outliers: The Story of Success"</a></mark>. gladwell popularized the idea that achieving a high level of proficiency in any field typically requires about 10,000 hours of dedicated practice. this notion is based on the research of psychologist <mark><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K._Anders_Ericsson">Anders Ericsson</a></mark>, who studied the practice habits of elite performers in various domains.</p>

      					<small>i've been tracking my programming time since 2019, so these numbers are based on that data. the actual total is likely higher, considering i wrote my first program before i started tracking my time! please note that i include this jokingly; i don't necessarily believe in the idea of becoming an expert after 10,000 hours. i haven't given it much thought, and i certainly don't feel like an expert yet.</small>
