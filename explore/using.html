              however, in my sleep, i accidentally threw this phone in the wall so it broke.
              so i bought the g06 instead (for less than $90 actually), as it also has NFC functionality. i use this for
              banking apps, and similar. my primary phone will be the light phone III 
              (as soon as it arrives, probably in january).

              for film photography, i'm using a canon eos 500 that i found in a
              second-hand store. the nikon coolpix p510 used to be my main camera, it
              has a really nice optical zoom, which you won't find in any
              smartphone, for example. i like this because you can take good
              photos from afar, and for people interested in birds, like me,
              it's a great feature. i just recently bought the nikon d850 
              which is known for being the best DSLR camera out there. 
              for more casual photos, i use a oneplus phone dedicated solely to photography.
