						<h3>about anti-AI hype</h3>
						<blockquote cite="https://antirez.com/news/158">I love writing software, line by line. It could be said that my career was a continuous effort to create software well written, minimal, where the human touch was the fundamental feature. I also hope for a society where the last are not forgotten. Moreover, I don't want AI to economically succeed. But, I would not respect myself and my intelligence if my idea of software and society would impair my vision: facts are facts, and AI is going to change programming forever.</blockquote>

						<p class="comment"><b>@tavro:</b> i agree with this statement and relate to it a lot, but i have slightly edited the quote to omit the author's political and economic opinions.</p>

						<h3>did AI kill Tailwind's business?</h3>
						<blockquote cite="https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss.com/pull/2388#issuecomment-3717222957">[1] The reality is that 75% of the people on our engineering team lost their jobs here yesterday because of the brutal impact AI has had on our business. Traffic to our docs is down about 40% from early 2023 despite Tailwind being more popular than ever.
							<blockquote cite="https://dri.es/ai-is-a-business-model-stress-test">[2] AI didn't kill Tailwind's business. It stress tested it. Their business model failed the test, but that is not an indictment of all Open Source business models.
Tailwind's business model worked for years. It relied on developers visiting their documentation, discovering Tailwind Plus while browsing, and buying it. Tailwind Plus is a $299 collection of pre-built UI components. Traffic led to discovery, and discovery drove sales. It was a reasonable business model, but always fragile.
In the last year, more and more developers started asking AI for code instead of reading documentation, and their sales and marketing funnel broke.

						<p class="comment"><b>@tavro:</b> i think Dries makes a good point here. the truth is probably somewhere in between. but what do i know? i am not running a company. still, i definitely think companies will have to adapt their business models to account for the integration of AI into society. on a positive note, <a href="https://x.com/OfficialLoganK/status/2009339263251566902">Google are now sponsoring Tailwind</a>.</p>
